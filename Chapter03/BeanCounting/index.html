        <h1>countBs</h1>
        <p>
            Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.
        </p>
        <h1>countChar</h1>
        <p>
            Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters).    
        </p>
        <h1>countBs Redux</h1>
        <p>
            Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.

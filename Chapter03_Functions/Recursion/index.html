        <p>
            Here's another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:
            Zero is even.
            One is odd.
            For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.
            Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.
        </p>
        <p>
        Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?

        <h1>arrayToList</h1>
        <p>
            Write a function arrayToList that builds up a list structure like the one shown when 
            given [1, 2, 3] as argument. 
        </p>
        <h1>listToArray</h1>
        <p>
            Also write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. 
        </p>    
        <h1>prepend</h1>
        <p>
            Then add a helper function prepend, which takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input list, 
        </p>
        <h1>nth</h1>
        <p>
            and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns the element at the given position in the list (with zero referring to the first element) or undefined when there is no such element.
            If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of nth. </p>
